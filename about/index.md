We are three recent graduates from the [University of California,
Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) where we studied [Computer
Science](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/donald_knuth.png) and suffered through
courses like [164](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp15/) together.

We're going on a 4 week trip to Europe together this summer.  We will be
starting in England, heading up to Scotland, and then returning to London to
take the EuroStar to Paris.  After Paris we will be driving through France to
Italy, and will end our trip in Rome.  If you have suggestions for places to
visit, please [drop us a line](mailto:georgepearman@me.com)!

After Europe, George will start work at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com),
Vikram will continue his work at the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu),
and Garrett will join [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com).
