We are three recent graduates from the [University of California,
Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) where we studied [Computer
Science](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/donald_knuth.png) and suffered through
courses like [164](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp15/) together.

We're going on a 4 week trip to Europe together this summer.  We will be
starting in [England](/europe/england), heading up to [Scotland](/europe/scotland), and then
returning to London to take the EuroStar to Paris.  After Paris we will 
drive through [France](/europe/france) to [Italy](/europe/italy), and will end our trip in
Rome.  [Click here](/europe/findus) to view our current location. If you have
suggestions for places to visit, please [drop us
a line](mailto:georgepearman@me.com)!

After Europe, [George](http://georgepearman.com) will start work at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com),
[Vikram](http://www.vikrams.io) will continue his work at the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu),
and [Garrett](http://garrettf.com) will join [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
