We are three recent graduates from the [University of California,
Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu) where we studied [Computer
Science](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/donald_knuth.png) and suffered through
courses like [164](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs164/sp15/) together.

We're going on a 4 week trip to Europe together this summer.  We will be
starting in [England](/england), heading up to [Scotland](/scotland), and then
returning to London to take the EuroStar to Paris.  After Paris we will 
drive through [France](/france) to [Italy](/italy), and will end our trip in
Rome.  If you have suggestions for places to visit, please [drop us
a line](mailto:georgepearman@me.com)!

After Europe, George will start work at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com),
Vikram will continue his work at the [AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu),
and Garrett will join [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotallabs.com).
