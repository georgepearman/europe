__Reality:__ Rained as I walked to the train station, rained randomly and
lightly throughout the day

I spent about an hour commuting to Versailles this morning, with the intention
of visiting the [Château de Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles).  For those
unfamiliar, this is where Versailles is located:

Once I arrived in the city I grabbed some food near the station.

Breakfast/lunch was a chicken sandwich at 10:30 AM ish.  Apparently in France they also include
unborn chicken (egg) in chicken sandwiches, making them extra delicious.  Once
again the mayonnaise was superb.

As I approached the palace I took these quick shots:

The actual palace was closed today.  However, the
[gardens](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/gardens-and-park-of-the-chateau-) were
free and extremely large: walking through them took most of the day.

My favorite part of the gardens were these large mirrors that they had behind
the palace.  They led to some extremely interesting photos:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/10.jpg" title="Mirrors at Versailles"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/10.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

To the south of the palace lay some grass areas with interesting patterns.

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/20.jpg" title="South of the Palace"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/20.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

There were pools of water all over the place:

</figure>

Straight lines look good when I stand near their intersection.

</figure>

I believe they called this the "sky mirror":

<figure class="full">

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/26.jpg" title="Big Mirror"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/26.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

West of the palace was an incredible view that stretched very far into the
horizon. Close to the palace was a pool with statues in the middle.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/27.jpg" title="West of the Palace"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/27.jpg" alt="image"></a>

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/43.jpg" title="West of the Palace"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/43.jpg" alt="image"></a>

I walked west and found myself near some tree tunnels.  Again, I really enjoyed
taking a panorama with lots of straight lines.

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/30.jpg" title="Straight lines"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/30.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I continued walking as it started to rain.  I wanted to get a picture of this
statue in the rain from the other side (so you could see the face).

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/32.jpg" title="Rain on a pool of water"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/32.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

But of course by the time I got there it wasn't raining hard enough to see the
droplets in the water well.

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/33.jpg" title="Statue in water"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/33.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Walking onwards I found a much larger water pool with a horse and chariot.
I seem to recognize the view, so I would guess that it is famous.

I went back to the mirrors when there were slightly fewer people, because the
mirrors were so fun looking:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/49.jpg" title="More mirrors"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/49.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/48.jpg" title="More mirrors"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_13/48.jpg" alt="image"></a>

You can see me!

Here's a weird horn thing I found:

Another pool with statues:

Finally, it was time to leave:

Dinner: also a sandwich, this time - a cheese sandwich!
