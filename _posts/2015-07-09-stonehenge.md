I woke up around 6 AM again.  Grandma Kay and I had cereal and toast with
homemade strawberry jam for breakfast.  Grandma watered her plants and I filled
the watering cans using the well once she was done.

Grandma Kay's friend Margaret picked us up around 8:30 and we drove towards
[Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge).  Our first stop was at
[Woodhenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodhenge):

The wooden stumps were supposed to have been 9 meters tall back when the site
was built!

Next we drove for a couple minutes down the road to Stonehenge.  Stonehenge is
on the [Salisbury Plain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_Plain) and no
one really knows why it was built.  We parked near the visitor's center and got
on a bus to take us towards the site.  We got off the bus halfway and walked
from that point forward.  I climbed a small mound (which contained at least
1 dead person) and got a picture. Here's what the area around Stonehenge looks
like:

Once we had finished our journey to Stonehenge, we were able to walk around the
site:

I found a stone that seemed to have forgotten where it was supposed to be:

I also saw a lot of (mostly German) tourists:

Back at the tourist center we looked at some huts, which would have been
located near Woodhenge and would have been occupied by the people that built
Stonehenge:

Next we drove to Devizes to have a picnic lunch near the [Caen Hill Locks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caen_Hill_Locks).  While there we saw some boats climb the 237 foot flight of locks:

After lunch we walked up the hill to get an ice cream from a cafe at the top:

I took this panorama of the Caen Hill Locks on the way back to the car:

On the way home we passed through [Avebury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury) and looked at the stones from the car.  We also saw a [White Horse](http://www.visitwiltshire.co.uk/explore/the-great-outdoors/white-horses) and passed through [Marlborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough,_Wiltshire), which contains the second widest road in England:

For dinner we went to [The Four Horseshoes](https://thefourhorseshoessherfield.wordpress.com) in Sherfield where I had fish and chips:
