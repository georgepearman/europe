Uncle Richard and I spent the day at [Bletchley Park](https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk), which is the location where [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) worked on deciphering the [enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine).  We saw exhibits on both the code breakers of World War I and II, and of [_The Imitation Game_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/).

The first stop was the Bletchley Park Mansion, which housed some props
from _The Imitation Game_:

When we went outside it had changed from sunny to rainy, so we killed some time
under cover listening to the audio tour.  I also took a selfie with a nearby
grumpy statue:

Behind the mansion we found the middle (dead center) of [Milton Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes):

In one of the [huts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park#Huts) we saw some real
[Typex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typex) machines (British machines that
were adapted to work like the enigma machine):

In the museum part of Bletchley Park we saw a restored and visibly working [Bombe machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe) that was decoding a (German) message:

I also saw a statue of Alan Turing and a motorcycle used in the war to transport
urgent messages:

After visiting Bletchley Park, Uncle Richard and I went to pickup Angharad from
her work in [Staines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staines-upon-Thames) and
then to see Bronwen in an ice skating competition.  We arrived and saw
Bronwen's team win an event.  Their theme was [_The Dam Busters_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dam_Busters_(film)).

Angharad, Uncle Richard, and I went to [The King's Head](http://www.kingsheadpubashford.co.uk) for dinner where we all got steak with [peppercorn sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peppercorn_sauce) (and it came with a fried tomato!).  We drank [Marston's Pedigree](http://www.marstons.co.uk/beers/?brewer=marstons&tour=j).
