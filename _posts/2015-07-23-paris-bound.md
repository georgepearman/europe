#### Breakfast at Lunchtime

We all couldn't resist one last english breakfast.  Today's came from [Regency
Café](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_Café) and was excellent.

I made some slight modifications to the food before I ate it.  Gotta eat
everything with [Brown Sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_sauce).

I finished my meal before Garrett, and got a shot of him eating some egg on his
toast:

And I took some selfies while he ate (poor guy).

When breakfast was over we walked around for a while trying to find a nice
place to sit (we had our bags with us).  We ended up going to a very casual pub (had to go
to one last pub before we left) where we were able to read our books and relax
a little bit.  The day was spent wandering around close to King's Cross so that
we didn't need to go far to get to the Eurostar.

#### Dinner at [Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com)

Dinner was really really good.  I didn't get any shots of the food, but I will
definitely go back here when I next visit London.  Here's a picture of fancy
drinks that Vikram and I ordered:

#### Eurostar to Paris

We left for Paris on the [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com) after dinner.
Getting through security was extremely easy.

Here's some pictures of the train and station as we approached the train and
found our seats:

The [mannequin from yesterday's post]({{site.url}}/images/day_8/29.jpg) should take note:

By now I'm very comfortable taking photos that only tourists take.  Here's some
panoramas of inside the train:

After about 30 minutes, we were in France!

We arrived in Paris at about 11 PM.  This lady had a lot of luggage:

We took a cab to our Airbnb and didn't do much else this evening.  Looking
forward to wandering around the city tomorrow!
