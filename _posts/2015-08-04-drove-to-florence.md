__Weather Report: Too hot__

It was hard sleeping last night due to the heat.  I started reading [The Bourne
Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_(novel)) and have
been hooked since.  There were lots of mosquitoes, but they prefer Vikram over
me so I woke up with one bite whereas Vikram woke up with 7 bites on his left
hand alone.

We departed around 9:30 from [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan) towards [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence).  Instead of going straight to Florence, we stopped in [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa) to look at the [Leaning Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa).

#### Pisa

Pisa was very much a tourist town.  There were people selling products that had
recently fallen off of trucks in China (fake Prada, Louis Vuitton, you name
it).  The whole place was crowded with tourists; I heard a lot of English
compared to normal.

The Leaning Tower is strangely small compared to what I had imagined (similar
to how the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower) was much grander than I had remembered).

Vikram and I were not too impressed by the town (we didn't really like the
people-trying-to-sell-tourists-lots-of-junk vibe and found the tower to be less
impressive than the hype).  However, I got immense
enjoyment seeing all the people taking pictures with the Leaning Tower:

    {% endfor %}

It's pretty crazy how much the tower actually leans when you see it in real
life!

While Vikram and I didn't take any well choreographed photos with the tower, we
did take some selfies (at times to take a stealthy photo of a tourist):

#### Florence

It was 6 before we checked into our Airbnb, so we were pretty exhausted from
a day of traveling and driving around the countryside.

Our Airbnb is located in a "Limited Traffic Zone" which means we parked
elsewhere and took a bus to the area.  The area around the Airbnb is in the old
city and is gorgeous.  Here are some shots of random streets in the area:

After some time on Yelp, we selected [Trattoria Nella](http://www.yelp.com/biz/trattoria-nella-firenze) for dinner due to its location (3 minute walk) and good reviews online.  Dinner was excellent and the house wine (extremely cheap) was very good.

__Sidenote:__ Everyone buys bottled mineral water in Italy, which we find quite
strange.  In America you get free water and a good waiter won't let your water
glass remain empty for longer than a few minutes! Also, restaurants in Italy
charge cover fees (normally about 2 euros, just to sit down). This seems fine
in a fancy restaurant, but our meals are only about 8-10 euros normally, so
2 euros seems somewhat excessive. Regardless, the <s>food</s> fresh pasta in
Italy is excellent and good value.

This statue is in [Piazza Santa Trinita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_Santa_Trinita) which is only 1 minute from our Airbnb!

After dinner we walked around and found a crowded bridge.

Everyone was waiting for the sunset.  To occupy myself while waiting 
I took some selfies with a nearby statue:
