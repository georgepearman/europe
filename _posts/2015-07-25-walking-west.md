I set out at around 10 AM (I had trouble sleeping last night: it was noisy
since we had the windows open since it was hot and I had a nap at 8 PM).  No
fancy route tracking in this post unfortunately as my phone had extremely low
battery remaining (I wanted to save this for photographs).

#### Breakfast

I ate at a random cafe/bakery along my walk.  I got a cappuccino and an almond
croissant.  Ordering food without knowing French is easier than you might
expect: you point at the menu and make assorted sounds.

Paying for food without knowing French is also easy: you hand the clerk a 10
Euro note and receive change.

I walked from the Airbnb directly towards the west (today I knew which
direction was which).  Along the way I saw some interesting looking buildings.
Here are two that merited pictures:

    <figcaption>French Buildings</figcaption>
</figure>

Since I've been in France I've noticed that the French value their cars a lot
more than the English and Scottish do.  I see a lot of fancy cars like Audis,
BMWs, Ferraris, Lamborghinis.  I see a few more common cars like Peugeots and
Citroëns.

Here's a [Citroën](http://www.citroen.com/en/) that wishes it were a [Mini
Cooper](http://www.miniusa.com/content/miniusa/en.html):

<figure class="full">

</figure>

After walking for about 20 minutes, I happened to run into Vikram, who had left
the Airbnb about 15 minutes before I did.  We discovered that we had similar
destinations in mind for the day and walked together from that time forward.

After an hour of aimless walking (albeit towards the west) we stopped at [Parc 
Monceau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Monceau) where we people watched
for 20 minutes.  There's a lot more people running around parks in France than
there are in America!

Here's a well timed panorama from the park.  Normally we saw a huge density of
people on this path, but I got lucky and timed my shot well so that it looked
like the path is relatively empty.

#### Lunch

Lunch was at a Thai restaurant with a waiter that spoke fluent
[Hindi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi); I ordered Vietnamese
food.  The menu was entirely in French so I pointed at "Set Menu A" and got
seemingly random food (for a foreigner that doesn't understand French).  The
food was delicious, although somewhat expensive (when compared to a 4€
sandwich).

Dessert was Vietnamese [nougat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nougat) (I must
have ordered this with my set menu) which tasted like peanut butter and was
chewy.

#### [Arc de Triomphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe)

We turned left at an intersection and saw the (much anticipated) [Arc de
Triomphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe)!

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/9.jpg" title="Arc de Triomphe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/9.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>Arc de Triomphe</figcaption>
</figure>

As we got closer we saw a big intersection around the monument.  We took
a tunnel underground and found ourselves inside a (<s>large</s> humungous) roundabout.  I took
these panoramas while there:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/12.jpg" title="Arc de Triomphe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/12.jpg" alt="image"></a>

</figure>

A series of selfies taken as I walked under the [Arc de Triomphe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_de_Triomphe):

<figure class="third" style="padding-bottom:0px">

    <figcaption>Some triumphant selfies</figcaption>
</figure>

I must have caused quite a spectacle, because Vikram wanted to get in on the selfie action (just kidding, I forced him to join in):

<figure class="half">
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/23.jpg" title="Arc de Triomphe Selfie"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/23.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>More selfies</figcaption>
</figure>

The Arc de Triomphe is quite tall, and the viewing area is quite close, so
taking good panoramas is quite hard.  So I took some _bad_ panoramas that turned
out to be pleasingly goofy:

<figure class="full">
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/27.jpg" title="Arc de Triomphe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/27.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/28.jpg" title="Arc de Triomphe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/28.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Here's a view of the intersection, outwards from the Arc:

<figure class="full">
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/30.jpg" title="Outward from the Arc de Triomphe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/30.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>Outward view</figcaption>
</figure>

I realized later that I only actually took one normal (not a panorama or
selfie) picture of the Arc de Triomphe, here it is in its splendor:

<figure class="full">
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/13.jpg" title=""><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/13.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>Average photo</figcaption>
</figure>

The tunnel to and from the Arc tries to entertain its guests as they walk from
the streets to the Arc.  Here's a panorama of a panorama inside the tunnel:

<figure class="full">

#### [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower)

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/33.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/33.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We approached the [Eiffel Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower)
from a bridge, which allowed for some great pictures:

<figure class="full" style="padding-bottom:0px">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/35.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/35.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/43.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/43.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/41.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/41.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

<figure class="half" style="padding-bottom:0px; padding-top:0px">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/38.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/38.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/34.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/34.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

<figure class="third" style="padding-top:0px">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/36.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower Selfie"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/36.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/37.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower Selfie"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/37.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/42.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower Selfie"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/42.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

This photo was lined up <s>stupidly</s> perfectly so that the Eiffel Tower is
hidden behind a pole:

<figure class="full" >
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/39.jpg" title=""><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/39.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Some trees provided an iconic shot of the tower as we approached:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/44.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/44.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/47.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/47.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I got some artsy panormas of the legs of the tower:

<figure class="full">

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/50.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/50.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Once again I took selfies as I walked under the Eiffel Tower.  Vikram insisted
on partaking in the experience.

<figure class="third">

Vertical panoramas turned out to be a whole new world of fun (as in, I bent my
body in an arc of triumph):

<figure class="third">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/57.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/57.jpg" alt="image"></a>

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/59.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/59.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Here's a normal picture upwards from near the center of the Eiffel Tower:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/52.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/52.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Vikram and I spent almost an hour in the park near the Eiffel Tower ([Champ de Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champ_de_Mars)).  I read [The
Silkworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silkworm) (the sequel to [The
Cuckoo's Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling)) while
Vikram read the news.  Here's the fantastic views that we experienced in this
great atmosphere:

<figure class="third">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/60.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/60.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/63.jpg" title="Girl sits by Eiffel Tower"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/63.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/64.jpg" title="Eiffel Tower Selfie"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_11/64.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I feel like its worth noting: the Eiffel Tower is __seriously__ huge in
reality; pictures do not do it justice.  I _highly_ recomment that you see it
in person.

#### Dinner 

We bought cheese, veggies, and humus at a local grocery store and we went next
door to a bakery to get fresh baguettes.  Dinner was eaten at the Airbnb while
watching more [Would I Lie to You?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_(TV_series)), our new favorite show.  It was a delicious meal for a small cost.
