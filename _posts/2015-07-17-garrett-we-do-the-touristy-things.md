Yesterday we took the tube to Victoria with the intention of seeing the stuff
you'd typically see around City of London. We headed toward Big Ben.

Then walked along the Thames until we found a ferry station. We took a tour on
the river. We took some photos, but the sky was pretty overcast and you could
get a better shot of anything via Google.

We grabbed a drink at The Anchor, a riverside pub celebrating its 400 year
anniversary.

Standard tourist stuff.

Afterward we made our way back to Victoria to pick up the rental. 

There were quite a few Mercedes on the lot, but apparently they don't rent them
out to young people. :(

Instead, they gave us a new Vauxhall Astra. Photos pending.

  <figcaption>See, only 11 miles on it.</figcaption>

George drove us to the airbnb. We proceeded to endure a few hundred miniature
heart attacks due to driving on the left side of roads far too small for cars.

Again, we headed back into the city in the hopes of ordering some curry at
Dishoom. Unfortunately, we were not prepared to endure a 2 hour wait. So we
explored a bit before finding a burger joint. 

Since it wasn't too late, we hit up another pub and learned that despite
carrying every liquor under the sun, pubs are reluctant to serve cocktails.
Even when advertising them at the tables. From the looks of it, the locals just
order beer and the occasional glass of wine at pubs. We've had some confusing
conversations simply for ordering sides.

Then we crashed.
