We woke up at 7 AM to begin our (long) trip from [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice) to [Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan)!

The first train stop was in [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco)
(Monte Carlo), where we found a deserted town.  After some searching, I found
a local bakery that seemed to be frequented by chefs buying fresh bread for
their restaurants.  I managed to get an old French lady to sell me two coffees
and croissants the normal way - pointing and grunting.

We spent the next three hours or so on two trains.  The trains ran along the
Italian coast and the views were spectacular.  I finished reading [The
Silkworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silkworm) while traveling.

The next two trains took us to [Genova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genoa),
where we picked up a rental car.  First, we wandered around the in heat with
our bags, looking for lunch.

I got a delicious salad.  It had tuna, ham (good Italian ham, if that's
a thing), egg, olives, corn, mozzarella, and tomatoes and only cost $5!

After getting the rental car we drove to
[Milan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan), seeing some awesome mountains
near the coast.

Dinner was at some asian restaurant that we do not recommend (why eat asian
food in Italy? cause you're hungry and it's nearby).  Dessert was at
a crowded ice cream place; the smallest size was like twice the amount of ice
cream that I can eat at once.

We're really tired from our long day of traveling.  Looking forward to seeing
more of Milan tomorrow!
