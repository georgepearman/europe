I wandered around a lot this morning, but unfortunately didn't take too many
photos.

Here's some pictures along the south bank of the [Arno River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno).  Towards the
left of the first picture is the [Ponte
Vecchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponte_Vecchio).  The Ponte Vecchio seems
just like a street when you're on it.  In fact, I hadn't even realized
I crossed the river until I was on the other side!

I saw this store called "Marco Baroni" and kept thinking it said "macaroni."

### [Piazzale Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Michelangelo)

I walked up a hill to [Piazzale Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazzale_Michelangelo)
for a great view of [Florence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence).  The
Piazzale is basically like a big parking lot, not too picturesque.  The view
was great though!

### Lunch at [I Buongustai](http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-buongustai-firenze?osq=lunch)

[I Buongustai](http://www.yelp.com/biz/i-buongustai-firenze?osq=lunch) was hard
to find since the location on Yelp wasn't quite right.  Vikram and I spent
about 30 minutes within a block or two trying to find the lunch spot! The food
was average tasting, but really cheap!

After lunch I went back to the Airbnb (once again it was way to hot and humid
to walk a lot in the afternoon) where I read more of [The Bourne Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bourne_Identity_(novel)).  After some relaxation I went out again and wandered some streets.

#### Another [Twizy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Twizy)

'nough said.

#### Dinner

We ate dinner at a random restaurant without doing any [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/) research like we
normally do.  Once again we ordered a couple things but shared everything.  The
[Ribollita](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribollita) stole the show tonight.
We also got mushroom risotto and some desserts :)
