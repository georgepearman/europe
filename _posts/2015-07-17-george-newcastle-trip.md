We spent most of the day traveling, so this post will likely be short. 

We left our Airbnb around 8:15 AM and started driving towards
[Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk).  Once we arrived we headed straight to
breakfast.  We ate at [The Copper Kettle](http://thecopperkettle.weebly.com)
and all had a [full English breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast):

After breakfast we walked around (a long route towards the parked car) and took
some photos.

Here's our route:

...and here's some <s>photos</s> panoramas:

We decided to get some roadtrip snacks and drinks at a [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com) along the route.  Breakfast was very filling so these snacks allowed us to skip lunch.

I liked that Tesco had portable scanners:

We stopped in [Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds) to look around.  We
can best describe the city after visiting as the English equivalent of [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago).  We went to a coffee shop called [La Bottega Milanese](http://www.labottegamilanese.co.uk).  I got an [aeropress](http://www.aeropresscoffee.co.uk) drink.

We stopped in [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York) for dinner.  We ate at
[The Red Lion](http://redlionyork.com) and I had a lamb burger.

After dinner we walked around.  I took this photo of a river:

In general, I think we all really liked the atmosphere in York and would like
to spend more time in the town.

Stopping along the road allowed us to take some photos of the beautiful countryside.
Here's the <s>photos</s> panoramas I took:

We checked into our hotel near [Newcastle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne).  Turns out we got 4 twin beds; I lucked out and got two, so I put them together.
