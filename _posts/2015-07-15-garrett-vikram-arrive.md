Garrett and Vikram arrived at around noon.  I met them at Heathrow Airport.

We got off the train at [Green Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Park)
and walked north, trying to find somewhere to eat.  We ended up eating at [The
Burlington Arms](http://www.burlingtonarms.com) where Vikram had his first beer
on tap ever:

Garrett and I had fish and chips, Vikram had something inferior (you have to
have fish and chips as soon as possible when you arrive in London!).  This pub
tried to be fancy, but wasn't especially good.  I would have prefered less
fancy fish and chips.

We went to get the keys to our Airbnb.  After some coffee with the host, we
left our bags and returned to the city.  We wandered around for some time.

Next we went to go look at an interesting looking building.

It turned out to be a courthouse.

We saw an interestingly small building amidst larger, newer buildings.

We saw a humungous building amidst normal, average buildings.

For dinner we went to [Cittie of Yorke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cittie_of_Yorke), which was an excellent pub with lots of seating and beer.  We drank [Old Brewery Bitter](http://www.samuelsmithsbrewery.co.uk/site/product/old-brewery-bitter/).  Thanks for the pub recommendation Uncle Richard!

After dinner we went to a small store to get some things.  I purchased some
[Fruit Pastilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowntree%27s_Fruit_Pastilles)!

Garrett enjoyed looking at the [eggs](http://london-syndrome.tumblr.com/post/33638880930/british-eggs-mystery-solved).

We missed a train back home, but only had to wait one minute for the next.
Take notes, [BART](http://www.bart.gov).
