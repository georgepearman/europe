After some coffee at the Airbnb, we made our way into London, getting off the
Underground at [Victoria Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Victoria_station).

Our first stop on the route was a [Caffé
Nero](http://www.caffenero.co.uk/default.aspx).  Vikram got an Americano and
I got a double espresso. As I write this, I realize that we are addicted to
coffee.

After coffee we meandered towards and along the Thames.  I logged our route:

Here's an unidentified building along the walk:

We saw [Notre-Dame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Paris):

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/5.jpg" title="Westminster Abbey"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/5.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Just kidding, it was [Westminster Abbey](http://www.westminster-abbey.org).

I took a succession of selfies with Abbey.

Here's the Abbey from a weird angle:

We took some selfies with [Big Ben](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ben):

I took a panorama while on [Westminster bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Bridge).

For lunch we each had a [Cornish Pasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty) from the [West Cornwall Pasty Co](http://westcornwallpasty.co.uk).
Thank you Angharad for the recommendation!

After lunch we walked from Waterloo along the south bank of the Thames. 

I took an artsy photo of [Blackfriars Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_Bridge).

<figure class="full">

I took another panorama once we had passed through, this time I got Vikram and
Garrett in the shot.

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/33.jpg" title="Blackfriars Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/33.jpg" alt="image"></a>

We saw the [Millennium Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Bridge,_London).

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/36.jpg" title="Millennium Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/36.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We also saw [Shakespeare's Globe Theatre](http://www.shakespearesglobe.com).

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/39.jpg" title="The Globe"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/39.jpg" alt="image"></a>

We got on a tour boat at a dock near the Globe.

Once on the boat we saw many sights, including the [HMS Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Belfast_(C35)).

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/44.jpg" title="HMS Belfast"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/44.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/45.jpg" title="George and the HMS Belfast"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/45.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We also saw peculiar people. I couldn't tell if this man was a professional photographer, or just a hardcore
tourist:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/42.jpg" title="Hardcore Tourist"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/42.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I took a lot of photos of [Tower Bridge](http://www.towerbridge.org.uk):

<figure class="third">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/47.jpg" title="Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/47.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/48.jpg" title="Selfie with Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/48.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/49.jpg" title="Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/49.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

And now, a series of selfies taken while under Tower Bridge:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/50.jpg" title="Selfie taken under Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/50.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>Yet another picture of Tower Bridge</figcaption>
</figure>

Here's some panoramas that involve Tower Bridge:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/55.jpg" title="Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/55.jpg" alt="image"></a>

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/57.jpg" title="Tower Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/57.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

There used to be laws against advertising along the Thames. [Oxo](http://www.oxo.co.uk) got past
this with some clever windows on their building:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/63.jpg" title="Oxo factory"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/63.jpg" alt="image"></a>

Garrett eyes [the Eye](https://www.londoneye.com) in this photo:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/62.jpg" title="Garrett eyes the Eye"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/62.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

One final panorama from the boat:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/61.jpg" title="London Eye Panorama"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/61.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We disembarked the boat tour at the same location (near the Globe).  We then walked to [The Anchor](http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/pub/anchor-bankside-southwark/p0977/) (400 year old pub that Shakespeare supposedly visited) for a drink.  

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/67.jpg" title="The Anchor"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/65.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/68.jpg" title="George, Vikram, and The Anchor"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/66.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I drank [1730 Special Pale Ale](http://www.taylor-walker.co.uk/1730/); Garrett and Vikram drank something <s>weird
and fruity</s> inferior.

We picked up our rental car later that night. We got a new car, with only 11 miles on the odometer!
The car is a [Vauxhall Astra](http://www.vauxhall.co.uk/vehicles/vauxhall-range/cars/new-astra/overview.html?&ppc=uk_Astra_Core+%5BE%5D_PPC_ENG_2012_08_Vauxhall_GB_Astra+-+Core+%5BE%5D__Exact).

After dropping the rental car off at the Airbnb, we went back into London for
some dinner. I found a man on a swing in a birdcage near [King's Cross
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station).
Once I was past him and couldn't be seen, I took a photo:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/71.jpg" title="Man on swing in a birdcage"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/71.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>
 
We had planned to go to [Dishoom](http://www.dishoom.com) but found a 2 hour line when we arrived:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/72.jpg" title="Crazy Dishoom line"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/72.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Instead, we ended up going to [Honest Burgers](http://www.honestburgers.co.uk), which I found to be quite
delicious (they used pickled onions when making their grilled onions!).  Also
the fries were some of the best I've had.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/73.jpg" title="Honest Burgers"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/73.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We didn't want to go home right after dinner, so we went to a nearby pub called
[The Lucas Arms](http://gkpubs.co.uk/pubs-in-london/lucas-arms-pub/).

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/75.jpg" title="The Lucas Arms"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_2/75.jpg" alt="image"></a>

We went home to sleep before our earlier morning tomorrow.
