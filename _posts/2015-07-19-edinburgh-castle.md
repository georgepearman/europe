We started our day with a walk from our Airbnb along the [Royal
Mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mile).

When we got hungry we stopped to eat.  I got something called [Scotish Tapas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas),
which was like a collection of small "bites" to eat. The food was delicious.

We finished our walk along the Royal Mile at [Edinburgh Castle](http://www.edinburghcastle.gov.uk).  It was there that we met every other tourist in the city.  It took us about 30 minutes to buy tickets into the castle; we recommend buying them online if you visit Edinburgh.

The castle visit was well worth our money as the castle and the views were
spectacular to look at:

One of the main attractions of Edinburgh Castle is the [Honours of Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_of_Scotland).  This was the line to get into the viewing room:

I wasn't allowed to take photos of the jewels.  I did get some other shots
inside the castle, however:

A cool bend in the road made for some artsy panoramas:

I walked down a pathway and happened to get a picture of Garrett and Vikram
admiring the scenery:

I also got a shot from above:

Here's the obligatory selfie from our castle trip:

After visiting the castle we had a wander around the town, mostly along [Princes
Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princes_Street).  We stopped for a coffee
at [Wellington Coffee](https://plus.google.com/115905568654208713896/about?gl=uk&hl=en).  I got a double espresso.  Vikram's latte had some artwork in the milk:

</figure>

The coffee shop was below street level, so we speculated that it was called
"wellington" coffee due to flooding when it is really rainy.  Speaking of rain,
here's a street corner in the rain:

We ended the day with a relaxing couple of hours in the Airbnb, where we played
cards before dinner.  We ate dinner at an Indian restaurant that we wouldn't
visit again.  We ended the night at [The Southsider](http://www.thesouthsiderpub.co.uk) where we watched professional darts and argued about nerdy computer science stuff.
