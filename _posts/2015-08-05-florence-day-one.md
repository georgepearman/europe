It was really hot today, and many restaurants use misters to cool their guests.
If you look near the middle of this photo, you can see some people 
are using umbrellas to shield themselves from the misters, which I found to be
funny and perplexing.

Here's a generic Florence street; they're a lot of fun since cars rarely drive.
When cars do drive, pedestrians are often slow at getting out of the way.

#### [Piazza della Signoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Signoria)

The [Piazza della
Signoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_della_Signoria) is a 1 minute
walk from our Airbnb, which is in an excellent location.
The most iconic building in the Piazza della Signoria is the [Palazzo
Vecchio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_Vecchio).  In my opinion this
building does not look too great.

Here's some statues under archways ([Loggia della Signoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggia_dei_Lanzi)):

This is the [Fountain of Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_of_Neptune,_Florence).  There were lots of people everywhere in this plaza, including right in front of the fountain.

#### [Rivoire](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rivoire-firenze-2)

Breakfast/lunch was spaghetti with clams (Vikram had cake because he wasn't too
hungry for some reason).  We ate at
[Rivoire](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rivoire-firenze-2) in the Piazza della
Signoria.

After lunch we had a lazy afternoon due to the crazy heat.  We went in some
stores and then went to the Airbnb for reading and napping.

#### Dinner

The best meal that Vikram and I have ever had was at [Pensavo
Peggio](http://www.yelp.com/biz/pensavo-peggio-firenze).  By now we're experts
at eating in Italy, so we split everything.  We got the lasagna, and the
truffle beef (which came with potatoes).  Dessert was tiramisu (like usual).
They gave us free lemoncello at the end of the meal (presumably due to our
charisma).

#### [Basilica of Santa Maria Novella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_Novella)

After dinner we walked around Florence some more.  Here's the [Basilica of
Santa Maria
Novella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Santa_Maria_Novella) where
we saw a lot of people sitting listening to some live music.

#### A weird car

I saw this [Renault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault) [Twizy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Twizy) while walking around.  This is a two-seater (one person in front of the other) electric car. Weird.

#### [Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral)

The [duomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral) was unlike any
other cathedral I have seen so far.  It was extremely intricate while still
looking very "flat" from the front.  Lots of people sat in front and the
streets nearby were very lively.  I expect most people in the city like to
enjoy the cool of night outside after the hot weather during the day.
