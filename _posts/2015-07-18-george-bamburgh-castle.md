We started with an oatmeal breakfast in the hotel, something that we purchased yesterday at Tesco. I went outside to enjoy some glorious weather while Garrett and Vikram got ready. Here's a photo of our hotel in the daylight, which is in a fantastically beautiful location. We certainly prefer this area over Seven Sisters Road (our previous accommodation).

Our first stop along our route to [Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh) was a trip to [Alnwick Castle](http://www.alnwickcastle.com).  We didn't pay to go into the castle since we didn't have too much time.  However, we did find a treehouse with a coffee shop!

After drinking some caffeine we explore the treehouse more, finding cool rope
bridges:

We took a random turn off the road, and found ourselves at [Bamburgh Castle](http://www.bamburghcastle.com):

We stopped for lunch in the town.  I had a [Ploughman's Lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploughman%27s_lunch).  It might have been the best meal I've had so far on this trip.

After lunch relaxed by the big grass area, and then walked up a mound to take
some more photographs.

We arrived in Edinburgh later.  After returning the car to Sixt at the airpost,
we took a bus back to town and explored.
