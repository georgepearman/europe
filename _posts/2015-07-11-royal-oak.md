For lunch we went to [The Royal Oak](https://www.oldenglishinns.co.uk/our-locations/the-royal-oak-pirbright) in [Pirbright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirbright) where we met Grandma Val's sister and brother-in-law:

I drank Uncle Richard's favorite beer, [T.E.A](http://www.hogsback.co.uk/product/t-e-a/) and had bangers and mash to eat again (you can never have too much).  The gravy was made with [pickled onion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_onion) (which is one of my top 3 favorite foods) and was really tasty.

After our (nearly 3 hour) lunch, we took some pictures outside:

Next, we drove to [Farnborough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnborough,_Hampshire) where Grandma Val lives and Uncle Richard and my
mother grew up.  I took photos of my mom's primary school, church, and old
house:

We also passed a cemetery where Uncle Richard couldn't resist:

> People are dying to get in there.

> Its the dead center of Farnborough

After looking around Farnborough we took Grandma Val home and had a cup of tea
with Grampi Ken:

We returned home to Feltham for a relaxing evening and barbecue:
