I woke up around 7:30 AM this morning and had cereal and toast with Grandma Kay
for breakfast.  We walked down the road and caught the 9 o'clock bus to
[Basingstoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basingstoke).  I quickly got onto
a train to Waterloo and read more of [The Cuckoo's
Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Calling) on the way to
London.

I arrived at [Waterloo
Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Waterloo_station) around 10:30 AM
and got a coffee from [Costa Coffee](http://www.costa.co.uk), which is a chain
I've only seen in England so far, and seems like a competitor to Starbucks.

Grandma Val and I (and everyone else in London) had arranged to meet under
a large clock in Waterloo:

We walked towards the [London Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Eye)
and caught a [City Cruise](http://www.citycruises.com/city-cruises-experiences-special-offers.aspx?gclid=COWglavv0sYCFYLJtAodQzcHRg) boat towards [Greenwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich).  The trip took 1 hour and 20 minutes.  We saw many sights along the [River Thames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames) and one of the crew members gave descriptions of the scenes from the front of the boat.

I took some photos that looked like this because I had a sunscreen (yes I wore
sunscreen, mom) smudge on my phone's camera lens:

I did manage to notice the smudge and take a few more photos:

I took this photo of the [Cutty Sark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutty_Sark) as we approached Greenwich:

Grandma Val and I immediately headed to lunch.  We went to [The Greenwich
Union](http://www.greenwichunion.com) which I found on [Yelp](http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/the-greenwich-union-london):

While we were looking at the beer menu and deciding what we wanted, the waiter
came out with four beers for us to taste.  In the end Grandma got the wheat
beer and I got [Fool's Gold](http://www.meantimebrewing.com/our-beers/limited-edition/beer/shortlist-fools-gold/).  We both got a [Ploughman's Lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploughman%27s_lunch) to eat.

Next we went to the [National Maritime Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Maritime_Museum).  While there I saw a boat that wished it was a spaceship, and a big replica engine:

After London, Grandma Val and I headed back to Feltham.  We had an indian
takeaway for dinner:

My favorite part of the dinner was the [onion bhaji](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/onionbhaji_85976):

After dinner, Grandma Val, Uncle Richard, and I sat outside around a outdoor
furnace while Bronwen played guitar and sang.
