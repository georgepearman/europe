Grandma Kay and I met at Waterloo station and walked towards the [London Film
Museum](http://londonfilmmuseum.com/home/).  We stopped to have a cappuccino at
the [Charles Dickens Coffee House](https://plus.google.com/117022728591701461989/about?gl=uk&hl=en):

The next stop was the exhibit at the Film Museum, which is located right next
to the [London Transport Museum](http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk).  The Film Museum
was having a special exhibit on the [James Bond](http://www.007.com) cars.

The first car we saw was an old [Rolls Royce](http://www.rolls-royce.com).
This one is from [Goldfinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(film))
(notice that the license plate is AU1).

Here's some more photos of cars:

It was fairly dark inside and I was taking photos with my phone, so it was
quite difficult to get good shots.  One photo came out focused on the wrong
thing:

I did get a couple good panoramas though:

This [Aston Martin Vantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Martin_V8_Vantage_(1977)) could ski in [The Living Daylights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Daylights):

You can see my reflection in this 007 sign:

When we had finished in the exhibit we walked through [Covent Garden](http://www.coventgardenlondonuk.com), where we saw a [levitating man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvYkRzpq4g):

We ate lunch at [Maxwell's](http://www.maxwells.co.uk).

After lunch we went to [Saint Paul's Cathedral](https://www.stpauls.co.uk).  We
got there on the bus.  Since they don't accept cash on the bus, you need to use
an [Oyster card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster_card) or a credit card
with a wireless chip in it.  I had neither.  Supposedly [Apple Pay](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/contactless/other-methods-of-contactless-payment/apple-pay?cid=applepay) should work on the buses, but after 5 minutes of fumbling around with this on the bus, the bus driver just let me get on for free.

Here's some pictures that I took while outside Saint Paul's Cathedral.

We found a statue of a man who we presumed to be Saint Paul:

Here's [Queen Anne](http://secret-cities.com/2010/03/26/the-statue-of-queen-anne-at-st-pauls/) with Saint Paul's Cathedral:

Here's me and Anne and Saint Paul's Cathedral:

</figure>

We thought about going inside Saint Paul's, but they wanted Â£16.00 per person to look
around!

Grandma and I decided to head back.  I tried to get on a bus again, but wasn't
able to score a free trip this time.  We ended up taking a weird route back to
Waterloo.  This involved going on the [London
Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground) for the first
time on this trip. I ended up buying an [Oyster card](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/oyster/using-oyster/where-you-can-use-oyster) after being annoyed with the inconvenience of not being able to get on a bus.

Grandma Kay and I met Uncle Richard at Waterloo.  Then Grandma went home and
Uncle Richard and I got on an overground train towards Feltham.  Here's a sneaky photo of
Uncle Richard:

Once home, we had some veggies and dip and some [Tanglefoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_%26_Woodhouse#Tanglefoot) (Uncle Richard's favorite beer to drink from a can).  For dinner we had [Hunter's Chicken](http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2303654/hunters-chicken), potatoes, and peas.  Thank you for cooking Uncle Richard!

Angharad pead on the floor; I took an artsy photo of my plate of food.

Next we relaxed.  So did Rita.

Later on in the evening, Uncle Richard and I went to [The Three Horseshoes](https://plus.google.com/107377162557467748076/about?gl=uk&hl=en), which, as you can see on this map, is very close to the middle of Feltham:

We met two of Uncle Richard's friends at the pub.  Here's Dave and my
[Guinness](http://www.guinness.com/en-gb/), which featured a shamrock on top.
