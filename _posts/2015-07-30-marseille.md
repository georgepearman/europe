We left Lyon around 11 or 12 today and drove to Marseille.  Instead of taking the
3 hour route, we opted for a longer route with more scenery.  The drive was fun
since we got to see some French countryside.

Lunch was in a supermarket parking lot along the way where we had cheese and
bread (and I had a tomato).

After arriving at Marseille we walked around the harbor area.  There were a lot
of boats and a cathedral up on the hill.

This is the view from our Airbnb, which was a couple floors up.

Later than night we went for a walk with better lighting, allowing me to take
this shot:

We went to an "Irish Pub" during happy hour.  It was popular, but we were lucky
enough to sit outside by the boats.

Many people sat by the water with their feet wet, so we did too.  While there
we got to see this boat park:

Behind us was a large crowd of people dancing around some drummers.  The ceiling
was really cool!

I'm not quite sure how it happened, but I turned around to look at something and
next thing I know, Vikram had fallen in the water (apparently he was trying to
wet his hands).  After fishing him out, we went home to dry off.
