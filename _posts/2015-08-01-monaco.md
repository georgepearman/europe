Since it is so close to Nice, we took a day trip to Monaco today.  The drive
between the two cities was along the coast and was the nicest drive we have had
this whole trip.  The views were amazing and the road was not crowded or too
straight.

While there, we saw loads of fancy cars.  Here's one that was driving in front of us.  We
followed it for a while.

After getting out of the car we saw a [La
Ferrari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaFerrari) (a rare Ferrari).  I chased
after it to get a picture, but it was long gone before I could get a shot.

We were wary of eating in Monte Carlo, but the street food was only about
2 euros each!  I got some sort of artichoke rice pie thing.

#### Back in Nice

Near the Nice port is a World War I memorial:

The Nice port is fairly <s>dull</s> inactive compared to the beaches.  Regardless, here's some
panoramas I took near the area.

We spent some time reading by the ocean and enjoying the atmosphere.  It has
been hot our whole time in the south of France, and I have been enjoying the
weather in shorts!

Dinner was a salad from Subway since we haven't had too many vegetables lately.
