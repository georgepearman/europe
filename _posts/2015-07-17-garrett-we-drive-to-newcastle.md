Today we left London for Newcastle. We had a whole day for a 6 hour drive,
so we took a few detours along the way.

# Detour #1: Cambridge.

Cambridge was beautiful. We looked around town for some breakfast.

I ordered a Full English Breakfast at Agora of the Copper Kettle. Perhaps not
as _full_ as I expected, but still delicious.

We meandered around Cambridge, nearly losing our sense of direction. Cloudy
skies and winding roads make it difficult to orient yourself.

# Detour #2: Leeds

We stopped in Leeds for some coffee. Apparently it's the third largest city in
the country. It appears to be all about business. Lots of modern office
buildings and the like. Only based on the hour we spent there, it felt like the
Chicago of England.

We grabbed some Italian coffee. George tried Aeropress for the first
time. I discovered the joy of tubular ice "cubes".

# Detour #3: Yorkshire

We accidentally hopped on a road on the way to York. So we found ourselves in
York. Sort of. The town was surprisingly beautiful.

We saw a sign for a "Friday Fish and Chips Special" on the gate near a pub
called The Red Lion.

</figure> 

We were sold. But when we inquired about the special, the bartenders spent
a few minutes discussing among themselves before admitting they had no idea
what it was supposed to entail. Apparently the owners recently just put up the
sign. So we ordered a couple beers and sandwiches,

and headed out.

We learned how to pump gas by trial and error. I had a nice conversation with
the cashier at the gas station. Apparently you don't pay for the gas until
after you're finished pumping. Which creates some problems for the attendants.

We pulled over on the way to Newcastle to walk around the countryside for a bit.
This is what we (or rather, George and Vikram) intended to see on the drive.
Hooray for justification!

It was dark by the time we reached the hotel outside Newcastle.

Our original plan was to use Newcastle as a crash pad on the way to
Edinburgh---to not venture very far from the hotel. This turned out to be a good
idea, since everyone so far told us that there was nothing at all to do in
Newcastle.  I find it a little unfortunate. We've passed on an opportunity to
meet people in a town where the only thing _to_ do is drink and talk to
foreigners.
