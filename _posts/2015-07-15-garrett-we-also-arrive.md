Consider this an addendum to
[George's post](http://georgepearman.com/europe/england/garrett-vikram-arrive/).
This post is pretty barren of photos since I was too tired to consider whipping
out my camera at every opportunity.

Vikram and I flew into Heathrow yesterday. I joke that this isn't my first time
out of the country, I've hopped across the border to Tijuana before. But
walking through immigration makes it feel much more official.

We met up with George and took the tube into the city. We had a few hours to
kill, so naturally we found ourselves at a pub. In front of a police station.

We passed by many offices on the way in. It was just after noon, therefore time
for the suits to grab a beer for lunch. A few spiffy looking gentlemen came and
went while we were there. I'm grateful that I'll be working in the Bay--I'm too
young to wear a suit to work every day.

George and I ordered the fish 'n' chips. It wasn't bad at all, but anything is
an upgrade from airline food.

We took the tube to our airbnb. The owner describes the neighborhood as
"ungentrified," but just outside of the city. Many immigrants. He was making
some renovations when we first arrived, so we ducked out again to explore the
city.

There are a ridiculous amount of pubs..._everywhere_. It appears that everyone by
default just goes to a pub after work. 

At 8pm it was still in the mid 70s Fahrenheit. It was in the 80s underground,
and uncomfortably humid. I expected it to be cold, considering the preceding
weeks were much cooler in London. Instead I was drenched in sweat by the end of
the day. Hopefully Scotland will be cooler.

We got back to the airbnb around 9pm and promptly showered and crashed. Being
awake for 30 hours and subsiding on equal consumption of beer, water, and
coffee puts a bit of a toll on the body.

Traveling is odd. Unlike in Tijuana, after crossing the border here I didn't
feel like I was in a _different_ place. Sure, there are different _things_ but
I don't feel like I've crossed some big cultural boundary. The fact that
I really am in a different place is taking some time to hit me. Each
minor difference slowly adds up. For now I'll continue to fumble and pass
people on the wrong side of the sidewalk.
