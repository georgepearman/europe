We took a day trip to [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva),
Switzerland today.  The road was foggy and wet, so we didn't get the great
views that had hoped for on the drive there.  On our
return to [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon), however, we were able to see some fantastic landscape.

After parking the car north of [Le Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhône)
we walked along the river towards [lac Léman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Geneva).

We didn't actually know where we were and didn't have cell reception, so we
went to a Starbucks since we knew it would have free wifi.  I had to purchase
an extremely expensive coffee so that we didn't look like moochers:

Once we found ourselves on the map and looked up "cheap" food we set off again.

I found an intersection with too many wires.

We crossed over [Pont du Mont Blanc](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pont_du_Mont-Blanc_(Genève)) which had a lot of flags:

It had been raining the entire time we had been in Geneva so far.  Here's
a selfie showing the rain (we tried to look upset with varying success):

The bridge provided some awesome sights of the [Jet d'Eau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_d%27Eau).

I also found a sports car while walking along the bridge! (Can't wait for more
in [Monaco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco))

As we continued walking around the lake I took more photos of the Jet.

There's a walkway towards the Jet.  Naturally we took it.

The wind changed and we got sprayed a little.  Later while reading wikipedia
I found this tip:

>Unsuspecting visitors to the fountain—which can be reached via a stone jetty from the left bank of the lake—may be surprised to find themselves drenched after a slight change in wind direction.

We sat near the Jet along the lake.  Some birds sat near the Jet _on_ the lake.

The area became popular as the sun came out.

For those that want to experience the Jet's awesomeness:

The clouds looked awesome on our walk back as the sun was beginning to shine
more.

After driving back to Lyon and relaxing in the Airbnb for a little bit, we set
out to a sandwich shop that makes small ~2 Euro sandwiches.  I tried smoked salmon and
goat cheese, ham and [reblochon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reblochon), and [foie gras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foie_gras) with balsamic.
