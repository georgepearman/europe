__Fun fact of the day:__ Our apartment is four flights of stairs above the ground
floor.  This forces us to get exercise and provides artsy photos.  These stairs
are not illuminated at night, so getting back home is always fun.  I know when
I am on the right floor by looking at the different types of welcome mats in
front of the apartments.

The three of us set out together at 9 or 10.  We wanted breakfast, coffee, and
SIM cards.  The route we had in mind was simple: leave the apartment and go
south to [Orange](http://www.orange.fr/), which is on a big street with many
cafes and bakeries.  Instead we found ourselves a mile west of the apartment,
and decided to just grab some breakfast there (wherever we were).

Breakfast was a chocolate croissant (ordered in French like a <s>badass</s>
tourist).  It looks ordinary in the photo, but this was very good as it was
freshly baked!

After an hour or so more walking, it was time for coffee!  Ordering coffee is
easy despite being in France since all the important words are Italian.

#### Undirected Walking

We went back to the Airbnb to relax a little bit.  After 20 minutes or so,
I set out again, this time alone.  We hadn't purchased SIM cards and I didn't
have a map, so I had absolutely no clue where I was walking.

Here's an intersection with
a [statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_Column) in the center.

Lunch was a 3€ baguette. It was phenomenal mostly because the mayonnaise was
unlike anything I have ever tasted.  Instead of the American canned stuff, it
seemed like it was homemade and fresh, making for a delicious sandwich (I don't
even normally _like_ mayonnaise!).

    <figcaption>Lunch (the sandwich, not the arm!)</figcaption>
</figure>

I foresee a lot more lunches like this in the future since it was so cheap and
tasty!

#### [Muséum National d'Historie Naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/fr)

I found myself south of the river at the [Muséum National d'Historie
Naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/fr).

Here's some monkeys that I found outside the museum.

    <figcaption>Monkeys</figcaption>

The museum is connected to a long garden. I looked very touristy taking these
photos, but by now I'm used to it.

    <figcaption>There were actually a lot of people around, I was just lucky
    with the timing of these panoramas and didn't get many people in the shots</figcaption>

Here's a weird hut containing some wood:

#### [La Seine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine)

I found the river and walked along the south bank.

#### [Notre Dame de Paris](http://www.notredamedeparis.fr)

I saw many tourists while at [Notre Dame](http://www.notredamedeparis.fr).  Somehow I seemed to avoid large
crowds until now.  Many tourists were taking photos with iPads.

<figure class="half">

No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't find the [hunchback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunchback_of_Notre-Dame) :(

#### [The Louvre](http://www.louvre.fr/en)

I didn't go inside: the weather was too nice to spend my time looking at
paintings by dead people.

#### [Palais Garnier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palais_Garnier)

This is a famous opera house; its the opera house from [The Phantom of the
Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_of_the_Opera).

#### Ice Cream

I met up with Vikram at
[Berthillon](http://www.yelp.com/biz/berthillon-paris-2) which is on [Île Saint-Louis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Île_Saint-Louis).  I got two scoops: Tiramisu, and Roasted Pineapple and Basil.  The ice cream was fantastic.  We ate the snack while people watching by the river.

#### French Bakeries

There are bakeries scattered all over the place near our Airbnb.  All of them
have delicious treats on display and the bakeries smell delicious.

</figure>

Vikram and I stopped to get a (fresh, warm) [quiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiche) on
the way home.  My quiche was tomato and chorizo flavored.

<figure class="half">

#### Dinner

Believe it or not, dinner was still needed despite all that snacking.  After
eating the quiche we went home where I had a two hour nap.  We proceeded
outside around 8 PM to find most of the city still awake and dining.  It took
us an hour of walking around looking at places to eat before we found one that
was a good combination of cheap and tasty looking.

I ordered a hamburger which was cooked in the traditional French style: barely.
