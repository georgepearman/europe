I left from LAX at 3:35 PM today.  Here are some pictures from the trip:

The plane made great time on the trip and we "arrived" at [Heathrow](http://www.heathrowairport.com) by 9:30 AM.
However, as we got close, the plane started to go the wrong way!  We
circled around Heathrow for about 20 minutes.

After we arrived, we had to wait for another 15 minutes to find a parking spot
for the plane.  Then of course, I needed to see if they would let me in the
country:

Angharad and Uncle Richard were waiting for me at the arrival gate.  We went to
Feltham for a cup of tea and to play with the cats, Neville and Rita:

Grandma Val met us at Feltham and we went to [The Kingfisher](http://www.thekingfisherchertsey.co.uk) for lunch:

After lunch we took a short walk by the pub and the [River Thames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames) and then drove to pickup Bronwen from school.
We went back to Feltham, watched some
[Wimbledon](http://www.wimbledon.com/index.html), and relaxed until dinner.
Dinner was steak, potatoes, and salad (thank you Auntie Philippa!).

I went to sleep at 8:40, exhausted from two days of travel.
