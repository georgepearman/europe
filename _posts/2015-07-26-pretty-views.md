#### Breakfast

I left the Airbnb around 9 AM and headed to a market about half a mile away.
I got ingredients for breakfast, including more fresh baguettes, which were
still warm when I got back to the Airbnb!

This meal was quite filling and kept us going throughout the day.  I relaxed in
the Airbnb and may or may not have taken a nap.  It was very rainy today.  In fact,
Vikram went out and later came back completely soaked!

After the rain had stopped I went out and headed towards Île Saint-Louis.
Here's a shot of a bridge taken from a bridge:

    <figcaption>Bridges</figcaption>
</figure>

I walked near the river around the island.  On the walk I saw a bridge that I prompty approached (gotta take artsy photographs).

<figure class="full">

</figure>

I have a favorite spot on the island, its right on the western tip.  Here's the
spot as seen from the mainland:

</figure>

And these are the pictures that I took from that spot:

A vertical panorama featuring the tree and my shoes, taken from the same place:

#### [Square Jean-XXIII](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Jean-XXIII)

Here's some photos from a small park type area behind Notre Dame.

'Nuff said.

I got some cool pictures of Notre Dame while walking over another bridge.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/20.jpg" title="Notre Dame"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/20.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/32.jpg" title="Notre Dame"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/32.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

There were boats everywhere; I had to wait to get pictures without them in the
shot.

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/21.jpg" title="Notre Dame and a tour boat"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/21.jpg" alt="image"></a>

Once it had finally moved out of the frame, I took this photo:

I was looking for a bench that was not covered in rain water.  There were some
picnic tables under trees which I went to investigate:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/33.jpg" title="Picnic table location"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/33.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

and these are the pictures I took from the tables:

<figure class="full" style="padding-bottom:0px">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/35.jpg" title="Île Saint-Louis"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/35.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/39.jpg" title="Île Saint-Louis and a bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/39.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I also got this sweet sweet video while sitting at a table:

<figure class="full" style="padding-top:0px">
    <video controls loop autoplay muted>
      <source src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/bird.mov">
    </video>
</figure>

I sat along the river for about an hour reading [The
Silkworm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silkworm).  While reading, I heard
some loud planes.  Looking up, I saw these in the sky:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/46.jpg" title="Colorful planes"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/46.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/47.jpg" title="Colorful planes"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_12/47.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>Colorful planes</figcaption>
</figure>

I suspect these planes were related to the [Tour de France](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cycling/33665618).

After dinner we walked around looking for a dessert treat.  I found a large
collection of wine bottles to be extremely funny.

We got fresh [macarons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaron) that were super
soft:
