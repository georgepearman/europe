After waking up we went straight to the train station and departed for [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow).  Once we got to Glasgow we checked into our hotel and dropped our luggage off in the room.  Lunch was at [Hootenanny](http://glasgowhootenanny.co.uk) where we ate questionable food.  We wandered around [Buchanan Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchanan_Street) for a little while, and then got a subway to the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk).  

The University was deserted (and it was very wet!):

The school had a lot of very cool archways

We took some selfies in the rain:

After that we just sort of explored the city a little before heading back to
the hotel where I had a nap.

Once the rain had finished we ventured out to find some dinner.  We had
a relaxing evening watching more professional darts at a bar across the street
from the hotel, and watching [Would I Lie to
You?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_(TV_series)) later in
our room.
