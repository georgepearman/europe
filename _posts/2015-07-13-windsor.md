Angharad, Bronwen, and I started the day with breakfast at [Frankie and Benny's](http://www.frankieandbennys.com).  I had a traditional full English breakfast and my cousins had bacon and pancackes:

We went to the Feltham station where we waited for about ten minutes for the
next train:

When we arrived in [Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire)
I took a goofy photo of the [castle](http://www.windsor.gov.uk/things-to-do/windsor-castle-p43983) (turns out the Queen was actually in the castle while we were in Windsor!).

</figure>

We planned to get on a tour bus.  Here's some pictures from before we boarded:

<figure class="half">

</figure>

Once we were on the tour bus I took some panoramas from the top:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/17.jpg" title="Panorama on top of the tour bus"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/17.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I also took some photos of the castle while we waited to depart:

<figure class="third">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/13.jpg" title="Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/13.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/14.jpg" title="Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/14.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/18.jpg" title="Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/18.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We sat on the second floor of the bus, which was open.  It was raining at the
time so we were in for quite an experience.  Here's some pictures from the
trip:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/22.jpg" title="Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/22.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/27.jpg" title="Eton College"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/27.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/29.jpg" title="Eton"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/29.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/37.jpg" title="Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/37.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>
<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/28.jpg" title="Eton College"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/28.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/32.jpg" title="I don't remember where this was, probably Eton"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/32.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/36.jpg" title="Windsor Farm"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/36.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Here's a picture of me and [Windsor Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Bridge):

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/30.jpg" title="Windsor Bridge"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/30.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

A problem with being on the top floor of the bus was that the trees were quite
low.  Whenever we passed under a branch, Angharad and I had to duck since we
were on the outside side of the bus.  Despite our efforts, we got quite wet
from water falling off the branches.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/25.jpg" title="Branches are very close to my head"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/25.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Then a branch hit me in the face.  Don't worry, I got a selfie with it:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/33.jpg" title="Selfie with a tree branch thats about to hit me"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/33.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/34.jpg" title="A branch just hit me"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/34.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Here's some pictures that give an idea of how wet this bus tour really was:

</figure>

This is how everything looked from my perspective:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/31.jpg" title="Rain on my glasses the whole tour"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/31.jpg" alt="image"></a>

When the tour bus got back to the starting location, we found a Costa Coffee
and I had a double espresso. Angharad had English tea and Bronwen had some sort
of caramel latte drink.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/41.jpg" title="Bronwen at Costa Coffee"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/41.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

While we had planned to warm up and dry off in the Costa, it was actually
warmer outside than in.  We had to hold Angharad's tea pot to keep warm (some
people are excited in the background of the picture of me):

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/42.jpg" title="Holding a tea pot to stay warm"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/42.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/44.jpg" title="Holding a tea pot to stay warm"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/44.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

After coffee we went shopping at [H&M](http://www.hm.com/) (pronounced _hache_ and M) and [Top Shop](http://www.topshop.com/) so
that Bronwen could buy a sweater.  I entertained myself by finding a sign that
was missing a letter:

<figure class="third">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/48.jpg" title="British H&M"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/48.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/47.jpg" title="Top Shop"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/47.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/45.jpg" title="Missing an S, whoever made this was basic in the summer"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/45.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

This is a picture of the shopping area, taken from the tour bus earlier:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/19.jpg" title="Windsor shopping area"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/19.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

After getting a sweater we found a train at the old Windsor station:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/50.jpg" title="George and an old train"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/50.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We went to a sweet shop and Bronwen bought some blue sour raspberry balls:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/51.jpg" title="Sweet Shop"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/51.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/66.jpg" title="Blue sour raspberry balls"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/66.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We found that these made our tongues blue:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/63.jpg" title="George and Bronwen have blue tongues"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/63.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

After the sweet shop we went to [Nando's](http://www.nandos.co.uk) for lunch.
Bronwen had a chicken sandwich and Angharad and I shared a chicken.

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/58.jpg" title="Lunch at Nando's"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/58.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Next, we took some selfies in front of Windsor Castle:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/56.jpg" title="Selfie with Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/56.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

Bronwen got my phone and took some more selfies:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/59.jpg" title="Selfie with Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/59.jpg" alt="image"></a>

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/62.jpg" title="Selfie with Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/62.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/64.jpg" title="Selfie with Windsor Castle"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/windsor/64.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

We stopped by a [memorial to George V](http://www.thamesweb.co.uk/windsor/memorials/geov_mem.html) before getting back on the train:

When we arrived back in Feltham the girls gave me a mini tour of their town.
Bronwen wouldn't pose in front of [KFC](http://www.kfc.com) (her favorite) so I took a sneaky
panorama.  A woman that apparently didn't want to be featured on my blog with
her child started moving quickly out of the shot, creating a weird blur:

In the evening we watched [City
Slickers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101587/).  Since I hadn't been to a pub
yet and didn't want to break my combo, Uncle Richard and I went to [The
General Roy](http://www.sizzlingpubs.co.uk/thegeneralroyfeltham/) where we
drank [The Rev. James](http://www.sabrain.com/beers/draught/the-rev-james) and
something with a name I don't remember.
