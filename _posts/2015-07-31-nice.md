The morning was spent walking around [Marseille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille).  I found this cool hotel with a great view of the port.

We were pleasantly surprised with the town, and could have spent more
time in Marseille if we had the time in our schedule.

Around 1 PM we set off to Nice.  Here's Marseille and Nice on a map for some
perspective:

After arriving in [Nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice), I immediately
noticed how very blue the water is.  I guess that's why they call it the [Côte
d'Azur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera).

In other news, making the horizon level is difficult:

Walking along the coast towards the east, we encountered some people who were
[parasailing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasailing).  It looked like a lot
of fun!

Towards the end of the [Promenade des Anglais](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promenade_des_Anglais) we found a rock that a lot of people were jumping from.

I took this panorama of the Promenade, hoping to show how many people were
enjoying the beach and how there are many different public and private beach
areas along the coast.

Nearby there was a sign with directions to one of the best panoramas in the
world.  Naturally I had to see this, and walked up 90 meters to a landing
above.

Up at the top I took some more shots of the beaches.

This is what the panorama viewing site looked like:

Looking east, I saw a (hard to see in this picture) mischievous seagull and
a sailboat:

We walked back along the coast in the other direction.  Tired, we sat for
a little while near the beach and about an hour later, went to dinner.  Dinner
was at [le Lodge](http://www.lelodgerestaurant.com), which is located a couple
blocks from the coast.  I got to eat [French onion
soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_onion_soup), something I had been
meaning to order while here!
