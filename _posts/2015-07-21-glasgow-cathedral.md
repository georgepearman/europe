__Weather update: pleasant, aka not raining__

#### Lunch

We ate lunch at [Gourmet Burger Kitchen](http://www.gbk.co.uk) (GBK), which was _quite_
delicious!

We dropped our bags at Glasgow Central Station and stopped for a coffee.  My
espresso cup was comically small:

Needless to say I finished it fairly quickly.

#### Necropolis

Garrett and Vikram went to look at the [Scottish Football
Museum](http://www.scottishfootballmuseum.org.uk) and I had a wander around the
city.  

<figure class="full">

    <figcaption>Route to and through Glasgow Necropolis</figcaption>
</figure>

I walked towards the [Glasgow Necropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Necropolis) because I had seen pictures of it that looked interesting.  The route I picked was supposed to pass through the [Glasgow Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_Cathedral).  I took a panorama of what I thought was the cathedral:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/fake_cathedral.jpg" title="Not Glasgow Cathedral"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/fake_cathedral.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>Not Glasgow Cathedral</figcaption>
</figure>

However about 5 minutes later, I saw a much grander building, the _real_
cathedral!

<figure class="half" style="padding-bottom:0px">

Near the cathedral I took a quick selfie with [James White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_White,_1st_Baron_Overtoun) (some dude):

</figure>

I crossed over a bridge and headed to the middle of Glasgow:

    <figcaption>Panorama on a bridge to the Necropolis</figcaption>
</figure>

The necropolis had some great views:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/view1.jpg" title="View from the Necropolis"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/view1.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>Great views</figcaption>
</figure>

It also had some great graves:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves1.jpg" title="Graves"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves1.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves2.jpg" title="Graves"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves2.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>Great graves</figcaption>
</figure>

This picture was supposed to be of the graves, but Glasgow Cathedral stole the
spotlight:

<figure class="full">
    <a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves4.jpg" title="Graves and the Cathedral"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/graves4.jpg" alt="image"></a>
</figure>

I took some panoramas <s>to show just how many graves there were</s> because
I'm addicted to taking panoramas:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/gravepano2.jpg" title="Graves"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/gravepano2.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>More graves</figcaption>
</figure>

Some lucky dead people got extremely cool looking graves, which were more like
monuments than traditional graves.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/cool_graves.jpg" title="I'm jealous of these graves"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/cool_graves.jpg" alt="image"></a>

</figure>

<figure class="full">

    <figcaption>People are dying to have graves like these</figcaption>
</figure>

I took my photo with some statues:

    <figcaption>Me and a grave; haircut needed</figcaption>
</figure>

I looked inside one of the fancy grave buildings and saw what looked to be some
[weeping angels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeping_Angel):

    <figcaption>Don't blink!</figcaption>
</figure>

I took one final selfie with a statue and left:

#### Walk along the River Clyde

The next part of my walk took me alone the [River Clyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Clyde):

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/route.png" title="My route"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/route.png" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>My route</figcaption>
</figure>

I saw some spectacular views and cool architecture:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/walkpano.jpg" title="River Clyde"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/walkpano.jpg" alt="image"></a>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/walkpano0.jpg" title="River Clyde"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/walkpano0.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>Interesting buildings</figcaption>
</figure>

I also saw a Scottish BBC building:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/bbc_scotland1.jpg" title="Scottish BBC Building"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/bbc_scotland1.jpg" alt="image"></a>

    <figcaption>Scottish BBC Building</figcaption>
</figure>

I saw signs to a "Tall Ship" and _had_ to investigate.

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/tallship1.jpg" title=""><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/tallship1.jpg" alt="image"></a>
    <figcaption>This way to the Tall Ship!</figcaption>
</figure>

It was pretty tall, but not as spectacular as I had hoped:

<figure class="full">

    <figcaption>Tall ship</figcaption>
</figure>

I took a subway back to Glasgow Central.  I was careful to go in the right
subway:

<figure class="full">
	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/subway.jpg" title="Two subways"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_7/subway.jpg" alt="image"></a>

#### Return to London

We flew back to London and checked into our next [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) at around 10:15 PM.  We
had a relaxing evening and then went to sleep.
