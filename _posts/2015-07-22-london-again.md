I headed into London at around 8:30 this morning.  I walked from near the Bank
Underground Station (I got a bus) towards the river.  Along the way I saw a pub which was named
[_Hung, Drawn, and Quartered_](http://www.hung-drawn-and-quartered.co.uk).
What a lovely name.

I went to [The Kitchen @ Tower](http://www.thekitchenattower.com) for
breakfast.  It was _extremely_ delicious.

I had a wander around.  I was going to walk along the northside of the Thames,
but the path was blocked at one point.  I took this panorama during that short
portion of my walk:

</figure>

This is the route I ended up taking.  Clearly I was just walking without
a plan, just going towards whatever looked to be most interesting:

I saw the ["walkie-talkie" building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_Fenchurch_Street), which I quite like the look of:

At some point I met up with Uncle Richard, Auntie Philippa, Angharad, and
Bronwen.  We ate lunch at [Pizza Express](http://www.pizzaexpress.com) where
I had a __seriously delicious__ salad.

After lunch we had a little walk towards St. Paul's Cathedral.

I saw another great name for a restaurant:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_8/7.jpg" title="The Slug and Lettuce"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_8/7.jpg" alt="image"></a>

I also saw a tall building in the middle of the street where people apparently 
live:

Next, Uncle Richard went to work and the girls and I got on a double decker bus
towards [Leicester Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_Square).

We also saw a [guy with a bow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaftesbury_Memorial_Fountain) at [Piccadilly Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccadilly_Circus) and tried to copy the pose:

	<a href="{{site.url}}/images/day_8/24.jpg" title="Oxford Street"><img src="{{site.url}}/images/day_8/24.jpg" alt="image"></a>

and stopped at [Debenhams](http://www.debenhams.com) for a cheap drink (Angharad gets a massive discount):

Next, we went to [Hyde Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park,_London) to ride [Boris Bikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander_Cycles).

The show was excellent, we all thoroughly enjoyed it.  

After the show, we waited outside the stage door so that we could meet some
famous people.
