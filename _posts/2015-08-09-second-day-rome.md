We sort of walked around without a destination in mind in the morning.
At some point we went to lunch, and got the best seats in the restaurant
(perfect for watching people eat across the street or watching people walk by).

We had a fried Roman artichoke, which tasted like artichoke potato chips.  The
pizzas were humungous, so we each took half to go.

I turned around after taking some pictures and found Vikram in a weird pose:

#### [Sant’Eustachio Il Caffè](http://www.yelp.com/biz/santeustachio-il-caffè-roma-2)

We got the "blessing of Sant'Eustachio" once again.  [Sant’Eustachio Il
Caffè](http://www.yelp.com/biz/santeustachio-il-caffè-roma-2) is located about
10 minutes from our Airbnb and really close to the [Pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome) and serves the best espresso in the world.

There are some ruins in the middle of the street very close to our Airbnb.
This is the coolest part of Rome: old stuff all over in the midst of a "modern"
city.

In the evening we wandered along the river looking for somewhere to eat.  There
were some very nice sights:

Dinner was at some Mexican restaurant.  I don't know why we tried Mexican food
that wasn't from Mexico or California; it was a big mistake.

In order to fulfill my daily [tiramisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiramisu)
quota we stopped by a gelato place on the way home that doubled as a bakery.
