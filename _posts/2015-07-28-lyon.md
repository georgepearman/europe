We drove from Paris to Lyon today, arriving in [Lyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon) around 3 PM.  Along the way I ate yet another French sandwich.  We can't stop ourselves: they're so ridiculously cheap (~3 Euros) and delicious.

Before checking into our Airbnb we walked along the [Le Rhône](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhône) to see as much as we could.

I pretended to take a selfie, actually wanting to take a picture of a person
peeing in a weird outside urinal. Garrett got excited and joined it, blocking
the view with his head.  I took another photo after letting him know what was going
on.

Along the walk we noticed lots of boats turned into restaurants; we looked at
some menus and decided to head back here at dinner time.

After checking into the Lyon Airbnb and spending some time there, we headed back towards the east bank of Le Rhône.  We ate dinner on this boat / bar thing:

Dinner was beer and a (extremely delicious) cheese platter since we had
a weirdly timed lunch and this boat bar didn't serve real food.

After dinner we walked along another bridge, enjoying the river.
