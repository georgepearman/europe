I woke up around 6 AM (jet-lag not too bad) and had a cup of tea and some
[Weetabix](http://www.weetabix.co.uk).  I watched the news with Angharad and then left at about 8:45 AM.
This is what my walk looked like:

Along the way I saw a [Nando's](http://www.nandos.co.uk) which Angharad has
been saying is really good.  I also saw Vietnamese and Indian food right next
to each other:

I was intrigued by the crosswalks here because they have a stopping point in
the middle of the street with independent lights on each side:

I soon found that no one in Feltham seems to wait for the lights anyways.

It was only about 9 AM by the time I approached the station, so I went into
a [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.com) for a second breakfast.  I got
a regular coffee and what I thought to be a breakfast sandwich.  The sandwich
was actually just a sausage sandwich, which was good, and came with brown
sauce.  The Starbucks coffee here wasn't extremely hot like in the United States and it
came in a regular mug.  I also saw a sign that implied that frappucinos are only
available in the summer in the UK.

I had more time to kill, so I visited a nearby [Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.co.uk/a-home/index.htm) to get a UK SIM card.

I got on a 10:16 AM train to Reading and read some of [The Cuckoo's Calling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Calling) while traveling.  I transferred trains at Reading and headed to Bramley station where I met Grandma Kay.  Grandma Kay drove me the additional couple of miles to her house in [Sherfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherfield_on_Loddon), where we met her brother.

For lunch we had some homemade tomato soup and cheese sandwiches.  The food was
delicious:

After lunch I looked around and Grandma Kay dug up some potatoes for dinner:
