We made a couple of stops in the [Tuscany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany) area instead of going straight to Rome.  It was great seeing some countryside from the car (Florence is very city like, being a city and all).

#### [San Gimignano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gimignano)

Our first stop was in [San
Gimignano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gimignano). Getting a spot in the
parking lot took twenty minutes due to the towns disorganization. Once we were
parked, we had a great time, however.

The interesting part of the town is inside great walls.  Once we found
ourselves inside, most of the streets looked like this:

Breakfast/lunch was coffee and a Toscana sampler platter; delicious! One of the
meats was "bacon" but seemed raw, weird but tasty.

The best part of the town was the fantastic view:

#### [Sienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena)

We drove through [Sienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena) but didn't find
much there, so we kept driving towards Rome.

#### [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome)

We got to the Airbnb around 6:30 PM (we dropped the car off first).  Dinner was
at [La Vecchia Locanda](http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-vecchia-locanda-roma) where
we shared gnocchi (the best of my life) and some sort of steak with roast
potatoes.

After eating we wanted to explore the city (while it was more cool than during
the day).  We found a lot of booths along the [Tiber River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiber):

#### Cars in Europe

I found that in France and Italy people tend to not care about their cars as
much as people do in America.  I see many people park bumper to bumper, some
even use nearby poles as locators when parallel parking:
